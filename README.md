# GIF Deleter üéâ

## How does it work? ü§î

The script deletes all favorited GIFs by sending a request to Discord's API that replaces your current GIF list (saved through a proto-encoded blob) with an empty one

1. Prepares an empty list of GIFs
2. It encodes this empty list into the format used by Discord (base64 protobuf)
3. A request is sent to Discord‚Äôs servers, updating your settings with the empty list
